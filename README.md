## Rainfall Prediction Model
This project implements a rainfall prediction model using time series analysis techniques. It utilizes the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA models to forecast future precipitation based on historical rainfall data. The model is exposed through a Flask web application, allowing users to make predictions and evaluate model performance.
